# Lung-Surfactant-NR-analysis
Refnx-based analysis scripts for neutron reflectometry data of lung surfactant layers at the air/water interface, including options for guest proteins and multilayered structures.
The following datasets are included in this folder:

  Lipids at 35 mN/m
  Lipids at 45 mN/m
  Lipids + 10% SP-B at 35 mN/m
  Lipids + 10% SP-B at 45 mN/m
  Lipids + 10% SP-C at 35 mN/m
  Lipids + 10% SP-C at 45 mN/m
  
For each dataset, a Jupyter notebook is provided with the refnx code used to fit the corresponding neutron reflectometry data. In addition, the .mft files for the three contrasts used (d-lipids/ACMW, d-lipids/D₂O, and h-lipids/D₂O) are included.
